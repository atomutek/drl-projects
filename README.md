# Deep Reinforcement Learning projects

You will find here the projects for the Udacity Nanodegree for Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Projects

There are three projects for this course.

### Project 1: Navigation
The project 1 uses a Deep Q Network to solve the Banana environment.

### Project 2: Continuous Control
The project 2 uses a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to solve
the Reacher environment.

### Project 3: Collaboration and Competition
The project 3 uses a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to solve
the Tennis environment.
